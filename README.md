# Inexact Gradient Descent with Controlled Synchronization Steps

## Paper

This repository contains the simulation code for the paper [On the Convergence of Inexact Gradient Descent with Controlled Synchronization Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07797).

## Requirements

This code requires MATLAB software with optimization toolbox. In addition to that Jupytor Notebook environment with following python packages are required.
- numpy
- matplotlib
- h5py

## Usage

1. Add the path of `src` folder to MATLAB path.
2. Run main.m file in MATLAB software. It will generate a `results.mat` file containing simulation results.
3. Run `plot_results.ipynb` to visualize the results.
